# Overview #

The web UI is the "store front" of our system and needs to allow the
users to quickly get the information they need and reliably walk them
through the necessary tasks.

The requirements in this document apply to a new, yet to be designed
front end.

# Requirement Items #

UI0001
: A user must quickly find the details regarding associated realms and
certificates.

UI0002
: A user must easily find important navigation items like login/logout, 
switching realm and role.
