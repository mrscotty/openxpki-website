OpenXPKI is an enterprise-grade PKI/Trustcenter software supporting
well-established infrastructure components like RDBMS and Hardware
Security Modules. Flexibility and modularity are the project's key design
objectives.

Unlike many other OpenSource PKI projects OpenXPKI offers powerful features necessary for professional environments that are usually only found in commercial grade PKI products. (If you have ever wondered what could be done to provide continuous operation of a PKI without having to struggle with the system every time your CA certificate expires, OpenXPKI is probably the right thing for you.)

However, we also target small scale installations by providing quick-start configuration examples that allow to get a usable PKI running quickly.

OpenXPKI runs on most Unix-like operating system (verified on FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris/OpenSolaris and Mac OS X).
Database backends exist for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and DB2.
OpenXPKI also integrates with the RT Request Tracker and supports nCipher's nShield Hardware Security Modules.
