Currently, this is just a suggestion for replacing the current
website at www.openxpki.org. 

To add an article, just create a file in the \_posts/ directory. In the
YAML metadata, you can assign one or more of the following categories:

  frontpage

        Cause the article to show up on the main index page in
        the "Welcome to OpenXPKI" list box.

  beginner|intermediate|advanced|troubleshooting|third\_party|resources

        These categories show up in the sidebar as navigation items
